Found [this plugin][jekyll-atom] for [Atom][atom] that adds a nice little toolbar and post/draft creation commands to you command palette. It will greatly enhance your workflow especially if, like me, you don't want to muck about with Jekyll plugins and remain nice and clean for github pages publishing.
